Welcome to my personal website! My name is Janine and I am a **data scientist** based in **Berlin, Germany**. I hold a MSc in Data Science from **Hertie School** and a BS in Economics from the University of the Philippines. I have **over seven years** of professional experience in quantitative data analysis with organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Philippine Competition Commission.

I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for public policy with a focus on text classification and named entity recognition in domain-specific text. This has use cases ranging from the [detection of anti-competitive provisions in draft legislation](portfolio/legal-text-classification/index.qmd) to the parsing of SDG compliance reports. As most human data is textual in nature, I believe **NLP is key to understanding the world we live in**.

My programming language of choice is 
<span style='display: inline-block;'>Python {{< fa brands python >}}</span> and {{< fa brands r-project >}}. I also have some familiarity with SQL.

Outside of work, I am an aerial arts and pole dance enthusiast. In 2024, I competed in the International Aerial Cup and placed first in the amateur hoop categorgy.
