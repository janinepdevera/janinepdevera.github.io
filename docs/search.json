    "text": "About\n\n\nWelcome to my personal website! My name is Janine and I am a data scientist and economic researcher based in Berlin, Germany. I hold a MSc in Data Science from Hertie School and a BS in Economics from the University of the Philippines. I have over seven years of professional experience in quantitative data analysis with organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Philippine Competition Commission.\nI specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for public policy with a focus on text classification and named entity recognition in domain-specific text. This has use cases ranging from the detection of anti-competitive provisions in draft legislation to the parsing of SDG compliance reports. As most human data is textual in nature, I believe NLP is key to understanding the world we live in.\nMy programming language of choice is Python  and I have some familiarity with SQL.\n\nIn my past work, I have traveled to countries like Kazakhstan and Türkiye to conduct workshops with government officials on national accounting and input-output global value chain analysis.\nOutside of work, I am an aerial arts and pole dance enthusiast."

    "text": "Competition is at the heart of consumer welfare. This is why in many countries, competition bodies assess new and existing policies for anti-competitive provisions. Competition Impact Assessment (CIA) studies are necessary for ensuring that regulations strike a balance between meeting different sector objectives and preserving a competitive market environment.\nIdeally, most laws should be subjected to CIA and other types of regulatory assessments. But this is a time-consuming exercise: an initial review alone can take 2-4 months, according to an OECD1 representative I spoke to. With hundreds of new laws and regulations proposed in any given country each year, the need for an efficient approach to competition impact assessment is great. Having myself worked in the Philippine Competition Commission for nearly 4 years, I have first-hand experience of how such undertakings can severely strain resources.\nRecent years have shown that machine learning and AI, particularly large language models (LLM), can greatly aid in processing massive amounts of textual data. Legal texts are no exception, and this is precisely what I demonstrate in my master’s thesis. AI is no replacement for an expert’s thorough assessment, and when enacting policies with wide-ranging ramifications, human judgment must remain the final arbiter. But automation can be useful as a means of initial screening, with only those having problematic provisions meriting further review. Workloads would be significantly reduced.\nFor my model, I use a database of legislative documents in countries where a round of OECD CIA studies was conducted. In all, I gathered a corpus of 273 texts from 7 countries. Each unstructured PDF was parsed to extract paragraphs containing relevant textual information, resulting in a total of 7,335 unique paragraphs of which 2,104 have been manually labeled based on the 4 categories identified in the CIA checklist of the OECD:\nCategory D is lumped together with other miscellaneous provisions into a new category called Others. If the paragraph does not relate to any of the 4 categories, it is assigned a label of None. A good amount of processing had to be conducted to prepare the data for modeling. I discuss the data preparation step and provide an sample of the labeled dataset in this post.\nAutomating the initial screening of documents for CIA can be divided into two parts. First is identifying whether a law has provisions with potential anti-competitive effects. This is a yes or no question that can be framed as a binary classification task. Second: distinguishing between multiple categories of restrictions in laws that have been flagged in the first step. I treat this as a multi-class task."

The increasing presence and necessity of digital innovation in our daily lives has prompted governments worldwide to actively regulate platform activities in an effort to prevent and address perceived risks and harms.\nThe European Union is a global leader in this regulatory effort, enacting landmark legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Among other things, these regulations aim to safeguard consumer welfare, address issues concerning data privacy and misinformation, and promote healthy market competition. The European Commission communicates these initiatives to various stakeholders through comprehensive documentation available on the EU Press Corner. The archive comprises a wide variety of press materials like speeches, statements, news articles, and factsheets on the digital policy discourse.\nThe information contained in these documents can be used to explore and answer different policy questions. For example, determining the focus of the EU’s digital strategy through topic modeling, understanding how digital policy issues are communicated through sentiment analysis, or identifying key players and stakeholders through named entity recognition.\nWith the goal of using communication materials to analyze EU digital policy, I scraped the EU Press Corner website to construct a dataset of speeches that contain the keyword digital.\nThe whole process is rather straightforward. Applying keyword and document type filters to the archive yields paginated results of all press materials that satisfy the given criteria. I parse the URLs to obtain the main text and other metadata - document type, title, date published, and link to the document. I apply some quality checks (e.g. removing duplicates and empty articles) and save the result as csv and json files, which can later be imported as a dataframe.\nA part of this process can be seen in the code below. The full source code for the scraper can be found in this  repository.\n\n\nShow code\ndef extract_text(links):\n    '''Function for extracting information from each search result.'''\n\n    print(f\"Number of links: {len(links)}\")\n\n    with tqdm(total=len(links), desc=\"Extracting text\") as pbar:\n        with open('raw.csv', 'a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:\n            fieldnames = [\"document\", \"title\", \"date\", \"location\", \"text\", \"link\"]\n            writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n\n            for link in links:\n                soup = load_page(link)\n                title_elem = doc_elems = paragraph_elem = None\n\n                try:\n                    title_elem = soup.find(class_=\"ecl-heading ecl-heading--h1 ecl-u-color-white\")\n                    doc_elems = soup.find_all(class_=\"ecl-meta__item\")\n                    paragraph_elem = soup.find(class_=\"ecl-paragraph\")\n\n                except Exception as e:\n                    print(f\"Error on link {link}: {e}\")\n\n                title = title_elem.text if title_elem else np.nan\n                paragraph = paragraph_elem.text if paragraph_elem else np.nan\n\n                if doc_elems:\n                    doc, date, loc = (elem.text if elem else np.nan for elem in doc_elems[:3])\n                else:\n                    doc, date, loc = np.nan, np.nan, np.nan\n\n                writer.writerow({\n                    \"document\": doc,\n                    \"title\": title,\n                    \"date\": date,\n                    \"location\": loc,\n                    \"text\": paragraph,\n                    \"link\": str(link)\n                })\n\n\n\nNote: A smaller corpus of press materials (including statements, news articles, and fact sheets) specific to the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act is also available upon request."
